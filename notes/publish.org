Focus on the Exporting and Publishing section.

I could use =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= to customize the url path for each page.

* Publish Command

Publish:

#+begin_src
M-x org-publish-all (SPC m P a)
#+end_src

Force publish:

#+begin_src
M-: (org-publish-all t)
#+end_src

* Start HTTP Server

#+begin_src
python3 -m http.server --directory ~/www 8000
#+end_src

* Ideas

I think publishing would be more convenient if every page was html first.
