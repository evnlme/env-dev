M --> SF <--> PA.

Mark measurements.
Construct a shape envelope.
- Try [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm][Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm]].
- See polygonal approximation problem.
- Don't worry about the end points of each line. Focus on the angles.
Mark measurements.
Fit primitives into the envelope.
Mark measurements.
Create interior shapes using the primitives.
