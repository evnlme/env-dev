Drawing
- Concerns
  - How the head and jaw overlaps with the neck to connect to the torso.
  - How the breasts attach to and hang from the torso.
  - Proportions and perspective of the head and jaw and breasts.
  - I think it's interesting to think of figure drawing as a composition of boxes. Consider the proportions and perspectives of the boxes. How the boxes overlap and connect. The lighting of the boxes. Intentional curves and distortions.
  - Prerequisite is figure drawing.
    - Anatomy studies.
    - How clothes wrap and drape from the body.
- Stages
  - Composition exploration (e.g., thumbnailing).
  - Rough.
  - Shape refinement.
  - Value and color.
  - Rendering (e.g., details, line, edge, etc.).
- For each stage
  - Time limited.
- Before each stage except exploration
  - Drawing study.
- After the last stage
  - Judge each stage in relation to the whole.
  - Identify the weakest stage.
    - Bonus improvement stage.
- Pacing
  - Try one stage per day.
- Comments
  - The difficulty of each stage depends on the project. Composition has the greatest variance in difficulty.
  - I should focus on building from reference. It's difficult to apply many transformations simultaneously so start from one, then a few, and build build build. Eventually, acquiring and combining transformations will be a simple thing.
  - The goal is to create a drawing where there are aspects that are more appealing to me than the corresponding aspects in the reference.
- Transformation examples
  - Camera (perspective)
  - Proportions
  - Pose
  - Gesture
  - Shapes
  - Lighting
  - Clothes
  - Hair
  - Expression
