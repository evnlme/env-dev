#+title: Speaking

* V0001

Content: I want to get better at speaking on video but I don't have a lot of time. Here is what I'm going to do. Intentional practice. Practice and review loop. I hope to become good enough that I can enjoy watching myself while still being critical and reflective.

Look: Please stay still. Both the body and the head.

Sound: Yayaya. I wish my voice was smoother.

Feel: At least I moved less. I'm still moving a bit too much unintentionally. The content is all over the place. It does feel like my voice is clearer when I'm am standing still. I guess there is a grounding effect that makes my voice more solid when my body is under control.
